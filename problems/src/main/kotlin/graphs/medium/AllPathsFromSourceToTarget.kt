/**
 * Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1,
 * find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1 and return them in any order.
 *
 * The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i
 * (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node `graph[i][j]`).
