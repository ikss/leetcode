/**
 * You are given a positive integer n representing n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are also given a 2D array roads,
 * where `roads[i] = [ai, bi, costi]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi
 * with a cost of traveling equal to costi.
 *
 * You can buy apples in any city you want, but some cities have different costs to buy apples.
 * You are given the 1-based array appleCost where `appleCost[i]` is the cost of buying one apple from city i.
 *
 * You start at some city, traverse through various roads, and eventually buy exactly one apple from any city.
 * After you buy that apple, you have to return back to the city you started at, but now the cost of all the roads will
 * be multiplied by a given factor k.
 *
 * Given the integer k, return a 1-based array answer of size n where `answer[i]` is the minimum total cost
 * to buy an apple if you start at city i.
