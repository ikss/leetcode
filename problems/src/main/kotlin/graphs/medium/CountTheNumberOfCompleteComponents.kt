/**
 * You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n vertices, numbered from 0 to n - 1.
 * You are given a 2D integer array edges where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` denotes that there exists an undirected edge
 * connecting vertices ai and bi.
 *
 * Return the number of complete connected components of the graph.
 *
 * A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices,
 * and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.
 *
 * A connected component is said to be complete if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.
