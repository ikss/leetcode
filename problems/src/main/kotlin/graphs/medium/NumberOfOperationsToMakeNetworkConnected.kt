/**
 * There are n computers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by ethernet cables connections forming a network
 * where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a connection between computers ai and bi.
 * Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.
 *
 * You are given an initial computer network connections. You can extract certain cables between two directly
 * connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected.
 * If it is not possible, return -1.
