/**
 * You are given some lists of regions where the first region of each list includes all other regions in that list.
 *
 * Naturally, if a region x contains another region y then x is bigger than y. Also, by definition,
 * a region x contains itself.
 *
 * Given two regions: region1 and region2, return the smallest region that contains both of them.
 *
 * If you are given regions r1, r2, and r3 such that r1 includes r3, it is guaranteed there is no r2
 * such that r2 includes r3.
 *
 * It is guaranteed the smallest region exists.
