/**
 * There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 * The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where `graph[i]` is an integer array of nodes adjacent
 * to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in `graph[i]`.
 *
 * A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from
 * that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).
 *
 * Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.
