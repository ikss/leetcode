/**
 * You are given a positive integer n which is the number of nodes of a 0-indexed directed weighted graph and a
 * 0-indexed 2D array edges where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge from node ui to node vi
 * with weight wi.
 *
 * You are also given a node s and a node array marked; your task is to find the minimum distance from s to any of the
 * nodes in marked.
 *
 * Return an integer denoting the minimum distance from s to any node in marked or -1 if there are no paths from s to
 * any of the marked nodes.
