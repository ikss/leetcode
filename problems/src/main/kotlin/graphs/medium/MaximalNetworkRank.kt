/**
 * There is an infrastructure of n cities with some number of roads connecting these cities. Each `roads[i] = [ai, bi]`
 * indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi.
 *
 * The network rank of two different cities is defined as the total number of directly connected roads to either city.
 * If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted once.
 *
 * The maximal network rank of the infrastructure is the maximum network rank of all pairs of different cities.
 *
 * Given the integer n and the array roads, return the maximal network rank of the entire infrastructure.
