/**
 * You are given two 0-indexed strings source and target, both of length n and consisting of lowercase English letters.
 * You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where `cost[i]`
 * represents the cost of changing the character `original[i]` to the character `changed[i]`.
 *
 * You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string
 * and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that `cost[j] == z`,
 * `original[j] == x`, and `changed[j] == y`.
 *
 * Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations.
 * If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.
 *
 * Note that there may exist indices i, j such that `original[j] == original[i]` and `changed[j] == changed[i]`.
