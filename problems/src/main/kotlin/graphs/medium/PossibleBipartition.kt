 * We want to split a group of n people (labeled from 1 to n) into two groups of any size.

 * Given the integer n and the array dislikes where `dislikes[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that the person labeled ai
 * does not like the person labeled bi, return true if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.
