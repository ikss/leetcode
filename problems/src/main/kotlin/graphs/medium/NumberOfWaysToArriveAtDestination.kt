/**
 * You are in a city that consists of n intersections numbered from 0 to n - 1 with bi-directional roads between some
 * intersections. The inputs are generated such that you can reach any intersection from any other intersection and that
 * there is at most one road between any two intersections.
 *
 * You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array roads where `roads[i] = [ui, vi, timei]` means that there is a road
 * between intersections ui and vi that takes timei minutes to travel. You want to know in how many ways you can travel
 * from intersection 0 to intersection n - 1 in the shortest amount of time.
 *
 * Return the number of ways you can arrive at your destination in the shortest amount of time. Since the answer may be
 * large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
