/**
 * You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array queries.
 *
 * There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1. Initially, there is a unidirectional road from city i
 * to city i + 1 for all 0 <= i < n - 1.
 *
 * `queries[i] = [ui, vi]` represents the addition of a new unidirectional road from city ui to city vi.
 * After each query, you need to find the length of the shortest path from city 0 to city n - 1.
 *
 * There are no two queries such that `queries[i][0] < queries[j][0] < queries[i][1] < queries[j][1]`.
 *
 * Return an array answer where for each i in the range `[0, queries.length - 1]`, `answer[i]` is the length of the
 * shortest path from city 0 to city n - 1 after processing the first i + 1 queries.
