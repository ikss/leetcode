/**
 * You are given a directed graph of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.
 *
 * The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array edges of size n, indicating that there is a directed edge
 * from node i to node `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from node i, then `edges[i] == -1`.
 *
 * Return the length of the longest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return -1.
 *
 * A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node.
