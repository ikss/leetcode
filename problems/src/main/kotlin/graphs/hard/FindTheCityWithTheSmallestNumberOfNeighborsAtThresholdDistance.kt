/**
 * There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1. Given the array edges where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` represents
 * a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities fromi and toi, and given the integer distanceThreshold.
 *
 * Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most
 * distanceThreshold, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.
 *
 * Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.
