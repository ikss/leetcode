/**
 * You are given an array routes representing bus routes where `routes[i]` is a bus route that the ith bus repeats forever.
 *
 * For example, if routes[0] = [1, 5, 7], this means that the 0th bus travels in the sequence
 * 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> ... forever.
 * You will start at the bus stop source (You are not on any bus initially), and you want to go to the bus stop target.
 * You can travel between bus stops by buses only.
 *
 * Return the least number of buses you must take to travel from source to target. Return -1 if it is not possible.
