/**
 * Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of n nodes and three types of edges:
 * * Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.
 * * Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.
 * * Type 3: Can be traversed by both Alice and Bob.
 *
 * Given an array edges where `edges[i] = [typei, ui, vi]` represents a bidirectional edge of type typei between nodes
 * ui and vi, find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be
 * fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node,
 * they can reach all other nodes.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return -1 if Alice and Bob cannot fully traverse the graph.
