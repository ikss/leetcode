/**
 * ou are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in a connected undirected graph containing
 * exactly one cycle. The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).
 *
 * You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where `edges[i] = [node1i, node2i]` denotes that there is a
 * bidirectional edge connecting node1i and node2i in the graph.
 *
 * The distance between two nodes a and b is defined to be the minimum number of edges that are needed to go from a to b.
 *
 * Return an integer array answer of size n, where `answer[i]` is the minimum distance between the ith node and any
 * node in the cycle.
