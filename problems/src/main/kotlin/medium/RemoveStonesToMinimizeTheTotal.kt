/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array piles, where `piles[i]` represents the number of stones in the ith pile,
 * and an integer k. You should apply the following operation exactly k times:
 *
 * Choose any `piles[i]` and remove `floor(piles[i] / 2)` stones from it.
 * Notice that you can apply the operation on the same pile more than once.
 *
 * Return the minimum possible total number of stones remaining after applying the k operations.
 *
 * floor(x) is the greatest integer that is smaller than or equal to x (i.e., rounds x down).
