/**
 * Given an array of strings words, find the longest string in words such that every prefix of it is also in words.
 *
 * For example, let words = ["a", "app", "ap"]. The string "app" has prefixes "ap" and "a", all of which are in words.
 * Return the string described above. If there is more than one string with the same length,
 * return the lexicographically smallest one, and if no string exists, return "".
