/**
 * Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories.
 * In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):
 * * dir
 * * ⟶ subdir1
 * * ⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
 * * ⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
 * * ⟶ subdir2
 * * ⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
 * * ⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext
 *
 * If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this:
 * "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext".
 * Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.
 *
 * Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must
 * be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path
 * to file2.ext is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces.
 * Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.
 *
 * Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute
 * path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.
 *
 * Note that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.
