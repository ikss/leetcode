/**
 * Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.
 *
 * Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.
 *
 * A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
 *
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none)
 * deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
 *
 * * For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
