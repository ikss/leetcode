/**
 * Given a string s consisting only of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. You are asked to apply the following algorithm on the string any number of times:
 * * Pick a non-empty prefix from the string s where all the characters in the prefix are equal.
 * * Pick a non-empty suffix from the string s where all the characters in this suffix are equal.
 * * The prefix and the suffix should not intersect at any index.
 * * The characters from the prefix and suffix must be the same.
 * * Delete both the prefix and the suffix.
 *
 * Return the minimum length of s after performing the above operation any number of times (possibly zero times).
