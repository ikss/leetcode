/**
 * You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost.
 *
 * You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs `|s[i] - t[i]|`
 * (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).
 *
 * Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t
 * with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding
 * substring from t, return 0.
