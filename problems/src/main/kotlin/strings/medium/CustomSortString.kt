/**
 * You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique
 * and were sorted in some custom order previously.
 *
 * Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically,
 * if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.
 *
 * Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.
