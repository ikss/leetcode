/**
 * You are given a string s.
 *
 * You can perform the following process on s any number of times:
 * * Choose an index i in the string such that there is at least one character to the left of index i that is equal to
 * `s[i]`, and at least one character to the right that is also equal to `s[i]`.
 * * Delete the closest character to the left of index i that is equal to `s[i]`.
 * * Delete the closest character to the right of index i that is equal to `s[i]`.
 *
 * Return the minimum length of the final string s that you can achieve.
