/**
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of
 * the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
 * (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
 *
 * Given two strings source and target, return the minimum number of subsequences of source such that their
 * concatenation equals target. If the task is impossible, return -1.
