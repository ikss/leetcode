/**
 * A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of 0's (possibly none),
 * followed by some number of 1's (also possibly none).
 *
 * You are given a binary string s. You can flip `s[i]` changing it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of flips to make s monotone increasing.
