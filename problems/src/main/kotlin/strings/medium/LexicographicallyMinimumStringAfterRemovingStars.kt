/**
 * You are given a string s. It may contain any number of '*' characters. Your task is to remove all '*' characters.
 *
 * While there is a '*', do the following operation:
 *
 * Delete the leftmost '*' and the smallest non-'*' character to its left. If there are several smallest characters,
 * you can delete any of them.
 * Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all '*' characters.
