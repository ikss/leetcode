/**
 * In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest to lowest to all teams participating in the competition.
 *
 * The ordering of teams is decided by who received the most position-one votes. If two or more teams tie in the first
 * position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until
 * the ties are resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions,
 * we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.
 *
 * You are given an array of strings votes which is the votes of all voters in the ranking systems. Sort all teams
 * according to the ranking system described above.
 *
 * Return a string of all teams sorted by the ranking system.
