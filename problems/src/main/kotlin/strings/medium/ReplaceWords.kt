/**
 * In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another
 * longer word - let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root "help" is followed by the word "ful",
 * we can form a derivative "helpful".
 *
 * Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the
 * derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it.
 * If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.
 *
 * Return the sentence after the replacement.
