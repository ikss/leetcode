/**
 * Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string,
 * and then at each step perform either of the following:
 * * Append the character '0' zero times.
 * * Append the character '1' one times.
 * * This can be performed any number of times.
 *
 * A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).
 *
 * Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties.
 * Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
