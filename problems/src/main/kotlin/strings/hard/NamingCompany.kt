/**
 * You are given an array of strings ideas that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company.
 * The process of naming a company is as follows:
 *
 * Choose 2 distinct names from ideas, call them ideaA and ideaB.
 * Swap the first letters of ideaA and ideaB with each other.
 * If both of the new names are not found in the original ideas, then the name ideaA ideaB(the concatenation of
 * ideaA and ideaB, separated by a space) is a valid company name.
 * Otherwise, it is not a valid name.
 * Return the number of distinct valid names for the company.
