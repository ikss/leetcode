/**
 * Two strings X and Y are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of X, so that it equals Y.
 * Also two strings X and Y are similar if they are equal.
 *
 * For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar,
 * but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".
 *
 * Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.
 * Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is
 * such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.
 *
 * We are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other string in strs.
 * How many groups are there?
