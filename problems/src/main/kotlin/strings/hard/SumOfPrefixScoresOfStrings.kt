/**
 * You are given an array words of size n consisting of non-empty strings.
 *
 * We define the score of a string word as the number of strings `words[i]` such that word is a prefix of `words[i]`.
 *
 * For example, if words = ["a", "ab", "abc", "cab"], then the score of "ab" is 2, since "ab" is a prefix of both "ab" and "abc".
 * Return an array answer of size n where `answer[i]` is the sum of scores of every non-empty prefix of `words[i]`.
 *
 * Note that a string is considered as a prefix of itself.
