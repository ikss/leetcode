/**
 * In the video game Fallout 4, the quest "Road to Freedom" requires players to reach a metal dial called the
 * "Freedom Trail Ring" and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to open the door.
 *
 * Given a string ring that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key that represents
 * the keyword that needs to be spelled, return the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword.
 *
 * Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the "12:00" direction. You should spell all the characters
 * in key one by one by rotating ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned
 * at the "12:00" direction and then by pressing the center button.
 *
 * At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character `key[i]`:
 * * You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as one step.
 * The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of ring's characters at the "12:00" direction,
 * where this character must equal `key[i]`.
 * * If the character `key[i]` has been aligned at the "12:00" direction, press the center button to spell,
 * which also counts as one step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key
 * (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.
