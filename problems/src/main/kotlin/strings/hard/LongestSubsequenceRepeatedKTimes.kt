/**
 * You are given a string s of length n, and an integer k.
 * You are tasked to find the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s.
 *
 * A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing
 * the order of the remaining characters.
 *
 * A subsequence seq is repeated k times in the string s if seq * k is a subsequence of s,
 * where seq * k represents a string constructed by concatenating seq k times.
 *
 * * For example, "bba" is repeated 2 times in the string "bababcba", because the string "bbabba",
 * constructed by concatenating "bba" 2 times, is a subsequence of the string "bababcba".
 *
 * Return the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s. If multiple such subsequences are found,
 * return the lexicographically largest one. If there is no such subsequence, return an empty string.
