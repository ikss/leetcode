/**
 * Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters
 * (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters
 * (length of the run). For example, to compress the string "aabccc" we replace "aa" by "a2" and replace "ccc" by "c3".
 * Thus the compressed string becomes "a2bc3".
 *
 * Notice that in this problem, we are not adding '1' after single characters.
 *
 * Given a string s and an integer k. You need to delete at most k characters from s such that the run-length
 * encoded version of s has minimum length.
 *
 * Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of s after deleting at most k characters.
