/**
 * The following are the rules for a string abbreviation:
 *
 * 1. The initial abbreviation for each word is: the first character, then the number of characters in between, followed by the last character.
 *
 * 2. If more than one word shares the same abbreviation, then perform the following operation:
 *    * Increase the prefix (characters in the first part) of each of their abbreviations by 1.
 *        * For example, say you start with the words ["abcdef","abndef"] both initially abbreviated as "a4f". Then, a sequence of operations would be ["a4f","a4f"] -> ["ab3f","ab3f"] -> ["abc2f","abn2f"].
 *    * This operation is repeated until every abbreviation is unique.
 *
 * 3. At the end, if an abbreviation did not make a word shorter, then keep it as the original word.
