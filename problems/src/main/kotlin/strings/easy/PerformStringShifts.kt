/**
 * You are given a string s containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix shift,
 * where `shift[i] = [directioni, amounti]`:
 * * directioni can be 0 (for left shift) or 1 (for right shift).
 * * amounti is the amount by which string s is to be shifted.
 * * A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of s and append it to the end.
 * * Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of s and add it to the beginning.
 *
 * Return the final string after all operations.
