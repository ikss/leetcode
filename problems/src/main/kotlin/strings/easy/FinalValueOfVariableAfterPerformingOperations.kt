/**
 * There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:
 *
 * * ++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
 * * --X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
 *
 * Initially, the value of X is 0.
 *
 * Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations,
 * return the final value of X after performing all the operations.
