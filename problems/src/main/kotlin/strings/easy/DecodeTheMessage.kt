/**
 * You are given the strings key and message, which represent a cipher key and a secret message, respectively.
 * The steps to decode message are as follows:

 * * Use the first appearance of all 26 lowercase English letters in key as the order of the substitution table.
 * * Align the substitution table with the regular English alphabet.
 * * Each letter in message is then substituted using the table.
 * * Spaces ' ' are transformed to themselves.
 *
 * * For example, given key = "happy boy" (actual key would have at least one instance of each letter in the alphabet),
 *  we have the partial substitution table of ('h' -> 'a', 'a' -> 'b', 'p' -> 'c', 'y' -> 'd', 'b' -> 'e', 'o' -> 'f').
 *
 * Return the decoded message.
