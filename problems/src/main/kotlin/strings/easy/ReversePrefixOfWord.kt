/**
 * Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the
 * index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.
 *
 * * For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at
 * 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
 * Return the resulting string.
