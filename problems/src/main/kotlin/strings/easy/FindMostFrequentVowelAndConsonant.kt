/**
 * You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z').
 *
 * Your task is to:
 * * Find the vowel (one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u') with the maximum frequency.
 * * Find the consonant (all other letters excluding vowels) with the maximum frequency.
 *
 * Return the sum of the two frequencies.
 *
 * Note: If multiple vowels or consonants have the same maximum frequency, you may choose any one of them.
 * If there are no vowels or no consonants in the string, consider their frequency as 0.
 *
 * The frequency of a letter x is the number of times it occurs in the string.
