/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed string blocks of length n, where `blocks[i]` is either 'W' or 'B',
 * representing the color of the ith block. The characters 'W' and 'B' denote the colors white and black, respectively.
 *
 * You are also given an integer k, which is the desired number of consecutive black blocks.
 *
 * In one operation, you can recolor a white block such that it becomes a black block.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of operations needed such that there is at least one occurrence
 * of k consecutive black blocks.
