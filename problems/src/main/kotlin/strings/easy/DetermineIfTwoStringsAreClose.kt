/**
 * Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:
 * * Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
 * * * For example, abcde -> aecdb
 * * Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character,
 * and do the same with the other character.
 * * * For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
 *
 * You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.
 *
 * Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.
