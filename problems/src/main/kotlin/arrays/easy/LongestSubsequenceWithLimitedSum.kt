/**
 * You are given an integer array nums of length n, and an integer array queries of length m.
 *
 * Return an array answer of length m where `answer[i]` is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take
 * from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `queries[i]`.
 *
 * A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing
 * the order of the remaining elements.
