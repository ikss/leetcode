/**
 * You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n.
 * Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set,
 * which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error.
 *
 * Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.
