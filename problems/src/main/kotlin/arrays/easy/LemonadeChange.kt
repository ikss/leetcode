/**
 * At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order
 * one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with
 * either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction
 * is that the customer pays $5.
 *
 * Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.
 *
 * Given an integer array bills where `bills[i]` is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every
 * customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.
