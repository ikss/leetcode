/**
 * A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file
 * line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected
 * where `expected[i]` is the expected height of the ith student in line.
 *
 * You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in.
 * Each `heights[i]` is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).
 *
 * Return the number of indices where `heights[i] != expected[i]`.
