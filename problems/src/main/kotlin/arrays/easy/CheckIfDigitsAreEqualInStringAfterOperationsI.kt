/**
 * You are given a string s consisting of digits.
 * Perform the following operation repeatedly until the string has exactly two digits:
 *
 * * For each pair of consecutive digits in s, starting from the first digit,
 * calculate a new digit as the sum of the two digits modulo 10.
 * * Replace s with the sequence of newly calculated digits, maintaining the order in which they are computed.
 *
 * Return true if the final two digits in s are the same; otherwise, return false.
