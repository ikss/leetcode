/**
 * In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town
 * judge.
 *
 * If the town judge exists, then:
 * * The town judge trusts nobody.
 * * Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
 *
 * There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
 * You are given an array trust where `trust[i] = [ai, bi]` representing that the person labeled ai
 * trusts the person labeled bi.
 *
 * Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.
