/**
 * You are given a 2D array events which represents a sequence of events where a child pushes a series of buttons on a keyboard.
 *
 * Each `events[i] = [indexi, timei]` indicates that the button at index indexi was pressed at time timei.
 * * The array is sorted in increasing order of time.
 * * The time taken to press a button is the difference in time between consecutive button presses.
 *
 * The time for the first button is simply the time at which it was pressed.
 * Return the index of the button that took the longest time to push. If multiple buttons have the same longest time,
 * return the button with the smallest index.
