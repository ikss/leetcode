/**
 * You are given two arrays of integers, fruits and baskets, each of length n, where `fruits[i]` represents the quantity
 * of the ith type of fruit, and `baskets[j]` represents the capacity of the jth basket.
 *
 * From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:
 * * Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or equal
 * to the quantity of that fruit type.
 * * Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.
 * * If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.
 *
 * Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.
