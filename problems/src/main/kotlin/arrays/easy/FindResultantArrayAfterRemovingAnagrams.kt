/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed string array words, where `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * In one operation, select any index i such that 0 < i < words.length and words[i - 1] and `words[i]` are anagrams,
 * and delete` `words[i]` from words. Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index
 * that satisfies the conditions.
 *
 * Return words after performing all operations. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in any
 * arbitrary order will lead to the same result.
 *
 * An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original
 * letters exactly once. For example, "dacb" is an anagram of "abdc".
