 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. Your task is to perform the following operation
 * exactly k times in order to maximize your score:
 * 1. Select an element m from nums.
 * 2. Remove the selected element m from the array.
 * 3. Add a new element with a value of m + 1 to the array.
 * 4. Increase your score by m.
 * 5. Return the maximum score you can achieve after performing the operation exactly k times.
