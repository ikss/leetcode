/**
 * You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes.
 * The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.
 *
 * We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group,
 * which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore,
 * there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.
 *
 * Return the reformatted license key.
