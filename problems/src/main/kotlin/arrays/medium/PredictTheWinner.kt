/**
 * You are given an integer array nums. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.
 *
 * Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0.
 * At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array
 * (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`) which reduces the size of the array by 1.
 * The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.
 *
 * Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner,
 * and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.
