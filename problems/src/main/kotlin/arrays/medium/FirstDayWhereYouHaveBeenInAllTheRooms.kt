/**
 * There are n rooms you need to visit, labeled from 0 to n - 1. Each day is labeled, starting from 0. You will go in
 * and visit one room a day.
 *
 * Initially on day 0, you visit room 0. The order you visit the rooms for the coming days is determined by the
 * following rules and a given 0-indexed array nextVisit of length n:
 *
 * Assuming that on a day, you visit room i,
 * if you have been in room i an odd number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit a
 * room with a lower or equal room number specified by `nextVisit[i]` where `0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i`;
 * if you have been in room i an even number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit
 * room (i + 1) mod n.
 * Return the label of the first day where you have been in all the rooms. It can be shown that such a day exists.
 * Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
