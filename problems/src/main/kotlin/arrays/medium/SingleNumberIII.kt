/**
 * Given an integer array nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear
 * exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.
