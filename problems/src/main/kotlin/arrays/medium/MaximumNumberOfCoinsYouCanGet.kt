 * There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:
 * * In each step, you will choose any 3 piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
 * * Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
 * * You will pick the next pile with the maximum number of coins.
 * * Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
 * * Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.
 *
 * Given an array of integers piles where `piles[i]` is the number of coins in the ith pile.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of coins that you can have.
