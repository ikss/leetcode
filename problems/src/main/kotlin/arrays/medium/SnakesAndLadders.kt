/**
 * You are given an n x n integer matrix board where the cells are labeled from 1 to n^2 in a
 * [Boustrophedon](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon) style starting from the bottom left of the board
 * (i.e. board[n - 1][0]) and alternating direction each row.
 *
 * You start on square 1 of the board. In each move, starting from square curr, do the following:
 *
 * * Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)].
 * * * This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.
 * * If next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.
 * * The game ends when you reach the square n^2.
 *
 * A board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if `board[r][c] != -1`. The destination of that snake or
 * ladder is `board[r][c]`. Squares 1 and n2 do not have a snake or ladder.
 *
 * Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start
 * of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.
 *
 * For example, suppose the board is [[-1,4],[-1,3]], and on the first move, your destination square is 2.
 * You follow the ladder to square 3, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to 4.
 * Return the least number of moves required to reach the square n2. If it is not possible to reach the square,
 * return -1.
