/**
 * ou are given an integer array matches where `matches[i] = [winneri, loseri]` indicates that
 * the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.
 *
 * Return a list answer of size 2 where:
 * * answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
 * * answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
 *
 * The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.
 *
 * __Note__:
 * * You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
 * * The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.
