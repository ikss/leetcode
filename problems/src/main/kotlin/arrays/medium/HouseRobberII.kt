 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
 * Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle.
 * That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system
 * connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 *
 * Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you
 * can rob tonight without alerting the police.
