/**
 * You are given an integer array deck. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer.
 * The integer on the ith card is `deck[i]`.
 *
 * You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.
 *
 * You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:
 *
 * * Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
 * * If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
 * * If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.
 *
 * Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.
 *
 * Note that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.
