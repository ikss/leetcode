/**
 * You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right.
 * The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.
 *
 * You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:
 *
 * You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount
 * of fruit each basket can hold.
 * Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree)
 * while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
 * Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
 * Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.
