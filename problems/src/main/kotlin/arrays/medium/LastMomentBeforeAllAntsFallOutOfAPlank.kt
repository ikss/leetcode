/**
 * We have a wooden plank of the length n units. Some ants are walking on the plank,
 * each ant moves with a speed of 1 unit per second. Some of the ants move to the left, the other move to the right.
 *
 * When two ants moving in two different directions meet at some point, they change their directions and
 * continue moving again. Assume changing directions does not take any additional time.
 *
 * When an ant reaches one end of the plank at a time t, it falls out of the plank immediately.
 *
 * Given an integer n and two integer arrays left and right, the positions of the ants moving to the left and the right,
 * return the moment when the last ant(s) fall out of the plank.
