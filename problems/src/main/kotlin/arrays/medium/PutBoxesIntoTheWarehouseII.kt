/**
 * You are given two arrays of positive integers, boxes and warehouse, representing the heights of some boxes of unit
 * width and the heights of n rooms in a warehouse respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from
 * left to right where `warehouse[i]` (0-indexed) is the height of the ith room.
 *
 * Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:
 * * Boxes cannot be stacked.
 * * You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.
 * * Boxes can be pushed into the warehouse from either side (left or right)
 * * If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box,
 * then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.
