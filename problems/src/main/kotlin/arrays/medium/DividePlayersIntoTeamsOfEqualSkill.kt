/**
 * You are given a positive integer array skill of even length n where `skill[i]` denotes the skill of the ith player.
 * Divide the players into n / 2 teams of size 2 such that the total skill of each team is equal.
 *
 * The chemistry of a team is equal to the product of the skills of the players on that team.
 *
 * Return the sum of the chemistry of all the teams, or return -1 if there is no way to divide the players into teams
 * such that the total skill of each team is equal.
