/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.
 *
 * The average difference of the index i is the absolute difference between the average of the first i + 1 elements
 * of nums and the average of the last n - i - 1 elements. Both averages should be rounded down to the nearest integer.
 *
 * Return the index with the minimum average difference. If there are multiple such indices, return the smallest one.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * The absolute difference of two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.
 * The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided (integer division) by n.
 * The average of 0 elements is considered to be 0.
