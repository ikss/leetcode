/**
 * There are n tasks assigned to you. The task times are represented as an integer array tasks of length n,
 * where the ith task takes `tasks[i]` hours to finish. A work session is when you work for at most sessionTime
 * consecutive hours and then take a break.
 *
 * You should finish the given tasks in a way that satisfies the following conditions:
 * * If you start a task in a work session, you must complete it in the same work session.
 * * You can start a new task immediately after finishing the previous one.
 * * You may complete the tasks in any order.
 *
 * Given tasks and sessionTime, return the minimum number of work sessions needed to finish all the tasks
 * following the conditions above.
 *
 * The tests are generated such that sessionTime is greater than or equal to the maximum element in `tasks[i]`.
