/**
 * You are given an array books where `books[i] = [thicknessi, heighti]` indicates the thickness and height of the
 * ith book. You are also given an integer shelfWidth.
 *
 * We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have a total width shelfWidth.
 *
 * We choose some of the books to place on this shelf such that the sum of their thickness is less than or equal to
 * shelfWidth, then build another level of the shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has
 * increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down.
 * We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.
 *
 * Note that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.
 *  * For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf,
 *  the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.
 *  
 * Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner.
