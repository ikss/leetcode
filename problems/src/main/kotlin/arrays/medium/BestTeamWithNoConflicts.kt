/**
 * You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest
 * overall score. The score of the team is the sum of scores of all the players in the team.
 *
 * However, the basketball team is not allowed to have conflicts. A conflict exists if a younger player has a strictly
 * higher score than an older player. A conflict does not occur between players of the same age.
 *
 * Given two lists, scores and ages, where each `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` represents the score and age of the ith player,
 * respectively, return the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams.
