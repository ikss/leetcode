/**
 * You are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. You are also given two 2D integer
 * arrays guards and walls where `guards[i] = [rowi, coli]` and `walls[j] = [rowj, colj]` represent the positions
 * of the ith guard and jth wall respectively.
 *
 * A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their
 * position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard.
 * A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.
 *
 * Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.
