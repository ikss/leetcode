/**
 * You are given an m x n matrix maze (0-indexed) with empty cells (represented as '.') and walls (represented as '+').
 * You are also given the entrance of the maze, where `entrance = [entrancerow, entrancecol]` denotes the row and column
 * of the cell you are initially standing at.
 *
 * In one step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. You cannot step into a cell with a wall,
 * and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the nearest exit from the entrance.
 * An exit is defined as an empty cell that is at the border of the maze. The entrance does not count as an exit.
 *
 * Return the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the nearest exit, or -1 if no such path exists.
