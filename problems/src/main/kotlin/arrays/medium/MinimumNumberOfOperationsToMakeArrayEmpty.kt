 * You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.

 * There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:
 * * Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
 * * Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.
