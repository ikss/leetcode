/**
 * You are given n tasks labeled from 0 to n - 1 represented by a 2D integer array tasks,
 * where `tasks[i] = [enqueueTimei, processingTimei]` means that the ith task will be available to process at
 * enqueueTimei and will take processingTimei to finish processing.
 *
 * You have a single-threaded CPU that can process at most one task at a time and will act in the following way
 * * If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.
 * * If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the shortest processing time.
 * * If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.
 * * Once a task is started, the CPU will process the entire task without stopping.
 * * The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.
 *
 * Return the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.
