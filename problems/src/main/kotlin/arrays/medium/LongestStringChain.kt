/**
 * You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * wordA is a predecessor of wordB if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in wordA without changing
 * the order of the other characters to make it equal to wordB.
 *
 * For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".
 * A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, where word1 is a predecessor of word2,
 * word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with k == 1.
 *
 * Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.
