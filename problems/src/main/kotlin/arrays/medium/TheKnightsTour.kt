/**
 * Given two positive integers m and n which are the height and width of a 0-indexed 2D-array board,
 * a pair of positive integers (r, c) which is the starting position of the knight on the board.
 *
 * Your task is to find an order of movements for the knight, in a manner that every cell of the board gets visited
 * exactly once (the starting cell is considered visited and you shouldn't visit it again).
 *
 * Return the array board in which the cells' values show the order of visiting the cell starting from 0
 * (the initial place of the knight).
 *
 * Note that a knight can move from cell (r1, c1) to cell (r2, c2) if 0 <= r2 <= m - 1 and 0 <= c2 <= n - 1 and
 * min(abs(r1 - r2), abs(c1 - c2)) = 1 and max(abs(r1 - r2), abs(c1 - c2)) = 2.
