/**
 * In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in
 * his new invented basket. Rick has n empty baskets, the ith basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has m balls and needs to
 * distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.
 *
 * Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions x and y is |x - y|.
 *
 * Given the integer array position and the integer m. Return the required force.
