/**
 * You are starving and you want to eat food as quickly as possible.
 * You want to find the shortest path to arrive at any food cell.
 *
 * You are given an m x n character matrix, grid, of these different types of cells:
 * * '*' is your location. There is exactly one '*' cell.
 * * '#' is a food cell. There may be multiple food cells.
 * * 'O' is free space, and you can travel through these cells.
 * * 'X' is an obstacle, and you cannot travel through these cells.
 *
 * You can travel to any adjacent cell north, east, south, or west of your current location if there is not an obstacle.
 *
 * Return the length of the shortest path for you to reach any food cell.
 * If there is no path for you to reach food, return -1.
