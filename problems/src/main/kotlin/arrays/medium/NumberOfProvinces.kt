/**
 * There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not.
 * If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c,
 * then city a is connected indirectly with city c.
 *
 * A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.
 *
 * You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the ith city and the jth city are directly
 * connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.
 *
 * Return the total number of provinces.
