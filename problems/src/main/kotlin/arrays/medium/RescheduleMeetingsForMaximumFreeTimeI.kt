/**
 * You are given an integer eventTime denoting the duration of an event,
 * where the event occurs from time t = 0 to time t = eventTime.
 *
 * You are also given two integer arrays startTime and endTime, each of length n.
 * These represent the start and end time of n non-overlapping meetings,
 * where the ith meeting occurs during the time `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]`.
 *
 * You can reschedule at most k meetings by moving their start time while maintaining the same duration,
 * to maximize the longest continuous period of free time during the event.
 *
 * The relative order of all the meetings should stay the same and they should remain non-overlapping.
 *
 * Return the maximum amount of free time possible after rearranging the meetings.
 *
 * Note that the meetings can not be rescheduled to a time outside the event.
