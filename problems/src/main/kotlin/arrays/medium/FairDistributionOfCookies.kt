/**
 * You are given an integer array cookies, where `cookies[i]` denotes the number of cookies in the ith bag.
 * You are also given an integer k that denotes the number of children to distribute all the bags of cookies to.
 * All the cookies in the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split up.
 *
 * The unfairness of a distribution is defined as the maximum total cookies obtained by a single child
 * in the distribution.
 *
 * Return the minimum unfairness of all distributions.
