/**
 * A row-sorted binary matrix means that all elements are 0 or 1 and each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 *
 * Given a row-sorted binary matrix binaryMatrix, return the index (0-indexed) of the leftmost column with a 1 in it.
 * If such an index does not exist, return -1.
 *
 * You can't access the Binary Matrix directly. You may only access the matrix using a BinaryMatrix interface:
 * * BinaryMatrix.get(row, col) returns the element of the matrix at index (row, col) (0-indexed).
 * * BinaryMatrix.dimensions() returns the dimensions of the matrix as a list of 2 elements [rows, cols],
 * which means the matrix is rows x cols.
 *
 * Submissions making more than 1000 calls to BinaryMatrix.get will be judged Wrong Answer.
 * Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.
 *
 * For custom testing purposes, the input will be the entire binary matrix mat.
 * You will not have access to the binary matrix directly.
