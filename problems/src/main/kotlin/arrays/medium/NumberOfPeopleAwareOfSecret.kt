/**
 * On day 1, one person discovers a secret.
 *
 * You are given an integer delay, which means that each person will share the secret with a new person every day,
 * starting from delay days after discovering the secret. You are also given an integer forget,
 * which means that each person will forget the secret forget days after discovering it.
 * A person cannot share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.
 *
 * Given an integer n, return the number of people who know the secret at the end of day n.
 * Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
