/**
 * A room is represented by a 0-indexed 2D binary matrix room where a 0 represents an empty space and a 1 represents
 * a space with an object. The top left corner of the room will be empty in all test cases.
 *
 * A cleaning robot starts at the top left corner of the room and is facing right.
 * The robot will continue heading straight until it reaches the edge of the room or it hits an object,
 * after which it will turn 90 degrees clockwise and repeat this process.
 * The starting space and all spaces that the robot visits are cleaned by it.
 *
 * Return the number of clean spaces in the room if the robot runs indefinetely.
