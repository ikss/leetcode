/**
 * You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns,
 * where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0),
 * and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed).
 * You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.
 *
 * A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.
 *
 * Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.
