/**
 * You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains `nums[i]` balls.
 * You are also given an integer maxOperations.
 *
 * You can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:
 *
 * * Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.
 * * * For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2 and 3 balls.
 *
 * Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.
 *
 * Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.
