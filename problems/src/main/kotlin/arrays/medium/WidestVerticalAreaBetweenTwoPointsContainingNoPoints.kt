/**
 * Given n points on a 2D plane where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, Return the widest vertical area between two points such
 * that no points are inside the area.
 *
 * A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height).
 * The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.
 *
 * Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.
