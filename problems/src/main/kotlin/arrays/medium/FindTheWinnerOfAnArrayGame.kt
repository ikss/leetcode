/**
 * Given an integer array arr of distinct integers and an integer k.
 *
 * A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`).
 * In each round of the game, we compare `arr[0]` with `arr[1]`, the larger integer wins and remains at position 0,
 * and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins k consecutive rounds.
 *
 * Return the integer which will win the game.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.
