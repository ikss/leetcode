/**
 * You have n boxes. You are given a binary string boxes of length n, where `boxes[i]` is '0' if the ith box is empty,
 * and '1' if it contains one ball.
 *
 * In one operation, you can move one ball from a box to an adjacent box. Box i is adjacent to box j if abs(i - j) == 1.
 * Note that after doing so, there may be more than one ball in some boxes.
 *
 * Return an array answer of size n, where `answer[i]` is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls
 * to the ith box.
 *
 * Each `answer[i]` is calculated considering the initial state of the boxes.
