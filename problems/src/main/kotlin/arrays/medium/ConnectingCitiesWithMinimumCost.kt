/**
 * There are n cities labeled from 1 to n. You are given the integer n and an array connections where
 * `connections[i] = [xi, yi, costi]` indicates that the cost of connecting city xi and city yi
 * (bidirectional connection) is costi.
 *
 * Return the minimum cost to connect all the n cities such that there is at least one path between each pair of cities.
 * If it is impossible to connect all the n cities, return -1,
 *
 * The cost is the sum of the connections' costs used.
