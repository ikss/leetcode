/**
 * You are given a large sample of integers in the range `[0, 255]`. Since the sample is so large,
 * it is represented by an array count where `count[k]` is the number of times that k appears in the sample.
 *
 * Calculate the following statistics:
 *
 * * minimum: The minimum element in the sample.
 * * maximum: The maximum element in the sample.
 * * mean: The average of the sample, calculated as the total sum of all elements divided by the total number of
 * elements.
 * * median:
 * * * If the sample has an odd number of elements, then the median is the middle element once the sample is sorted.
 * * * If the sample has an even number of elements, then the median is the average of the two middle elements once
 * the sample is sorted.
 * * mode: The number that appears the most in the sample. It is guaranteed to be unique.
 * Return the statistics of the sample as an array of floating-point numbers [minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode].
 * Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
