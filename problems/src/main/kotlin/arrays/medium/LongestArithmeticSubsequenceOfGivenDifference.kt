/**
 * Given an integer array arr and an integer difference, return the length of the longest subsequence in arr which is
 * an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals difference.
 *
 * A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from arr by deleting some or no elements without changing the order
 * of the remaining elements.
