/**
 * There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0.
 * Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.
 *
 * When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it,
 * denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.
 *
 * Given an array rooms where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i,
 * return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.
