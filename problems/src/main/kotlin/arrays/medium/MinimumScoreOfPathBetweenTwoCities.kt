/**
 * You are given a positive integer n representing n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are also given a 2D array roads
 * where `roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi
 * with a distance equal to distancei. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.
 *
 * The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path.
 *
 * Return the minimum possible score of a path between cities 1 and n.
 *
 * Note:
 * * A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
 * * It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you can visit cities 1 and n multiple times
 * along the path.
 * * The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between 1 and n.
