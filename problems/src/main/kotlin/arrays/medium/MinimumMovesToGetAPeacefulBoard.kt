/**
 * Given a 2D array rooks of length n, where `rooks[i] = [xi, yi]` indicates the position of a rook on an n x n
 * chess board. Your task is to move the rooks 1 cell at a time vertically or horizontally (to an adjacent cell) such
 * that the board becomes peaceful.
 *
 * A board is peaceful if there is exactly one rook in each row and each column.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of moves required to get a peaceful board.
 *
 * Note that at no point can there be two rooks in the same cell.
