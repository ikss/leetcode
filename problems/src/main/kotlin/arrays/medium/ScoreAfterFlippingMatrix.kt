/**
 * You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.
 *
 * A move consists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in that row or column
 * (i.e., changing all 0's to 1's, and all 1's to 0's).
 *
 * Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.
 *
 * Return the highest possible score after making any number of moves (including zero moves).
