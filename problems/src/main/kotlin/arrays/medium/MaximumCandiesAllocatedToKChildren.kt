/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array candies. Each element in the array denotes a pile of candies of size
 * `candies[i]`. You can divide each pile into any number of sub piles, but you cannot merge two piles together.
 *
 * You are also given an integer k. You should allocate piles of candies to k children such that
 * each child gets the same number of candies.
 * Each child can be allocated candies from only one pile of candies and some piles of candies may go unused.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of candies each child can get.
