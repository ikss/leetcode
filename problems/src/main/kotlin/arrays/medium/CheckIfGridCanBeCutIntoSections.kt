/**
 * You are given an integer n representing the dimensions of an n x n grid, with the origin at the bottom-left corner
 * of the grid. You are also given a 2D array of coordinates rectangles, where `rectangles[i]` is in the form
 * `[startx, starty, endx, endy]`, representing a rectangle on the grid. Each rectangle is defined as follows:
 * * (startx, starty): The bottom-left corner of the rectangle.
 * * (endx, endy): The top-right corner of the rectangle.
 *
 * Note that the rectangles do not overlap. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make either two horizontal
 * or two vertical cuts on the grid such that:
 * * Each of the three resulting sections formed by the cuts contains at least one rectangle.
 * * Every rectangle belongs to exactly one section.
 *
 * Return true if such cuts can be made; otherwise, return false.
