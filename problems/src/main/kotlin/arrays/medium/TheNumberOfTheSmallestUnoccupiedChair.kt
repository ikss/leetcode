/**
 * There is a party where n friends numbered from 0 to n - 1 are attending.
 * There is an infinite number of chairs in this party that are numbered from 0 to infinity.
 * When a friend arrives at the party, they sit on the unoccupied chair with the smallest number.
 *
 * * For example, if chairs 0, 1, and 5 are occupied when a friend comes, they will sit on chair number 2.
 *
 * When a friend leaves the party, their chair becomes unoccupied at the moment they leave.
 * If another friend arrives at that same moment, they can sit in that chair.
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array times where `times[i] = [arrivali, leavingi]`,
 * indicating the arrival and leaving times of the ith friend respectively, and an integer targetFriend.
 * All arrival times are distinct.
 *
 * Return the chair number that the friend numbered targetFriend will sit on.
