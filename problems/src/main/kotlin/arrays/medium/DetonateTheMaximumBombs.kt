/**
 * You are given a list of bombs. The range of a bomb is defined as the area where its effect can be felt.
 * This area is in the shape of a circle with the center as the location of the bomb.
 *
 * The bombs are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array bombs where `bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]`. xi and yi denote
 * the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the ith bomb, whereas ri denotes the radius of its range.
 *
 * You may choose to detonate a single bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate all bombs that lie in its range.
 * These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.
 *
 * Given the list of bombs, return the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only
 * one bomb.
