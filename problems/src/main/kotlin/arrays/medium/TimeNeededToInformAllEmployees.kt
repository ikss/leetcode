/**
 * A company has n employees with a unique ID for each employee from 0 to n - 1. The head of the company is
 * the one with headID.
 *
 * Each employee has one direct manager given in the manager array where `manager[i]` is the direct manager of the i-th
 * employee, `manager[headID] = -1`. Also, it is guaranteed that the subordination relationships have a tree structure.
 *
 * The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an urgent piece of news.
 * He will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform their subordinates,
 * and so on until all employees know about the urgent news.
 *
 * The i-th employee needs `informTime[i]` minutes to inform all of his direct subordinates
 * (i.e., After `informTime[i]` minutes, all his direct subordinates can start spreading the news).
 *
 * Return the number of minutes needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.
