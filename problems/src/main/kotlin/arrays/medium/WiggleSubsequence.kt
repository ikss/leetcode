/**
 * A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between
 * positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative.
 * A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.
 *
 * * For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between
 *  positive and negative.
 * * In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because
 *  its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.
 * * A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence,
 *  leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.
