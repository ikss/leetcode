/**
 * You are given a string s and an integer t, representing the number of transformations to perform.
 * In one transformation, every character in s is replaced according to the following rules:
 *
 * * If the character is 'z', replace it with the string "ab".
 * * Otherwise, replace it with the next character in the alphabet. For example, 'a' is replaced with 'b',
 * 'b' is replaced with 'c', and so on.
 *
 * Return the length of the resulting string after exactly t transformations.
 *
 * Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
