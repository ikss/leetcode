/**
 * You are given two integers height and width representing a garden of size height x width. You are also given:
 * * an array tree where `tree = [treer, treec]` is the position of the tree in the garden,
 * * an array squirrel where `squirrel = [squirrelr, squirrelc]` is the position of the squirrel in the garden,
 * * and an array nuts where `nuts[i] = [nutir, nutic]` is the position of the ith nut in the garden.
 *
 * The squirrel can only take at most one nut at one time and can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right,
 * to the adjacent cell.
 *
 * Return the minimal distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one.
 *
 * The distance is the number of moves.
