/**
 * There is a game dungeon comprised of n x n rooms arranged in a grid.
 *
 * You are given a 2D array fruits of size n x n, where `fruits[i][j]` represents the number of fruits
 * in the room (i, j). Three children will play in the game dungeon, with initial positions
 * at the corner rooms (0, 0), (0, n - 1), and (n - 1, 0).
 *
 * The children will make exactly n - 1 moves according to the following rules to reach the room (n - 1, n - 1):
 *
 * * The child starting from (0, 0) must move from their current room (i, j) to one of the rooms (i + 1, j + 1),
 * (i + 1, j), and (i, j + 1) if the target room exists.
 * * The child starting from (0, n - 1) must move from their current room (i, j) to one of the rooms (i + 1, j - 1),
 * (i + 1, j), and (i + 1, j + 1) if the target room exists.
 * * The child starting from (n - 1, 0) must move from their current room (i, j) to one of the rooms (i - 1, j + 1),
 * (i, j + 1), and (i + 1, j + 1) if the target room exists.
 *
 * When a child enters a room, they will collect all the fruits there. If two or more children enter the same room,
 * only one child will collect the fruits, and the room will be emptied after they leave.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of fruits the children can collect from the dungeon.
