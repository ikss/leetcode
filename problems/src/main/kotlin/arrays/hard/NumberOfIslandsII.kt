/**
 * You are given an empty 2D binary grid grid of size m x n. The grid represents a map where 0's represent water and 1's
 * represent land. Initially, all the cells of grid are water cells (i.e., all the cells are 0's).
 *
 * We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land.
 * You are given an array positions where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position (ri, ci) at which we should operate
 * the ith operation.
 *
 * Return an array of integers answer where `answer[i]` is the number of islands after turning
 * the cell (ri, ci) into a land.
 *
 * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
 * You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
