/**
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of nums.
 *
 * A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between
 * any two consecutive elements is the same.
 *
 * For example, `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, `[7, 7, 7, 7]`, and `[3, -1, -5, -9]` are arithmetic sequences.
 * For example, `[1, 1, 2, 5, 7]` is not an arithmetic sequence.
 * A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.
 *
 * For example, `[2, 5, 10]` is a subsequence of `[1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 5, 10]`.
 * The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in 32-bit integer.
