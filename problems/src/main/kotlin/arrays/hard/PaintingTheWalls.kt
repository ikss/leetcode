/**
 * You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, cost and time, of size n representing the costs and the time taken
 * to paint n different walls respectively. There are two painters available:
 *
 * A paid painter that paints the ith wall in `time[i]` units of time and takes `cost[i]` units of money.
 * A free painter that paints any wall in 1 unit of time at a cost of 0. But the free painter can only be used
 * if the paid painter is already occupied.
 * Return the minimum amount of money required to paint the n walls.
