/**
 * You have n tasks and m workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed integer array tasks,
 * with the ith task requiring `tasks[i]` strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed
 * integer array workers, with the jth worker having workers[j] strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement (i.e., workers[j] >= tasks[i]).
 *
 * Additionally, you have pills magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by strength.
 * You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however,
 * you may only give each worker at most one magical pill.
 *
 * Given the 0-indexed integer arrays tasks and workers and the integers pills and strength,
 * return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.
