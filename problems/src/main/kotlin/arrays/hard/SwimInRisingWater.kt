/**
 * You are given an n x n integer matrix grid where each value `grid[i][j]`
 * represents the elevation at that point (i, j).
 *
 * It starts raining, and water gradually rises over time. At time t, the water level is t,
 * meaning any cell with elevation less than equal to t is submerged or reachable.
 *
 * You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if
 * the elevation of both squares individually are at most t. You can swim infinite distances in zero time.
 * Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.
 *
 * Return the minimum time until you can reach the bottom right square (n - 1, n - 1)
 * if you start at the top left square (0, 0).
