/**
 * A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is
 * printed as a string of digits s and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range `[1, k]`
 * and there are no leading zeros in the array.
 *
 * Given the string s and the integer k, return the number of the possible arrays that can be printed as s using
 * the mentioned program. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
