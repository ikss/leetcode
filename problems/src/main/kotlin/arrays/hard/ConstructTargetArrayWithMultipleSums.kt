/**
 * You are given an array target of n integers. From a starting array arr consisting of n 1's,
 * you may perform the following procedure:
 * * let x be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
 * * choose index i, such that 0 <= i < n and set the value of arr at index i to x.
 * * You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.
 *
 * Return true if it is possible to construct the target array from arr, otherwise, return false.
