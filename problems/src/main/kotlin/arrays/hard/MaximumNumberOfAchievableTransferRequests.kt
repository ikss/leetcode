/**
 * We have n buildings numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each building has a number of employees.
 * It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.
 *
 * You are given an array requests where `requests[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents an employee's request to transfer from
 * building fromi to building toi.
 *
 * All buildings are full, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the net change in employee
 * transfers is zero. This means the number of employees leaving is equal to the number of employees moving in.
 * For example if n = 3 and two employees are leaving building 0, one is leaving building 1, and one is leaving
 * building 2, there should be two employees moving to building 0, one employee moving to building 1,
 * and one employee moving to building 2.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of achievable requests.
