/**
 * You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.
 *
 * In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity `mana[j]` and must pass
 * through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the ith wizard
 * on the jth potion is `timeij = skill[i] * mana[j]`.
 *
 * Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current
 * wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working
 * on a potion exactly when it arrives.
 *
 * Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.
