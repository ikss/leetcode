/**
 * You have n flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom.
 * Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays
 * _plantTime_ and _growTime_, of length n each:
 *
 * * `plantTime[i]` is the number of full days it takes you to plant the ith seed. Every day,
 * you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days,
 * but the planting of a seed is not complete until you have worked `plantTime[i]` days on planting it in total.
 * * `growTime[i]` is the number of full days it takes the ith seed to grow after being completely planted.
 * After the last day of its growth, the flower blooms and stays bloomed forever.
 *
 * From the beginning of day 0, you can plant the seeds in any order.
 *
 * Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.
