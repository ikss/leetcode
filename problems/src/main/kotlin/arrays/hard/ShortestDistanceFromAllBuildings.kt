/**
 * You are given an m x n grid grid of values 0, 1, or 2, where:
 *
 * each 0 marks an empty land that you can pass by freely,
 * each 1 marks a building that you cannot pass through, and
 * each 2 marks an obstacle that you cannot pass through.
 * You want to build a house on an empty land that reaches all buildings in the shortest total travel distance.
 * You can only move up, down, left, and right.
 *
 * Return the shortest travel distance for such a house. If it is not possible to build such a house according
 * to the above rules, return -1.
 *
 * The total travel distance is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.
 *
 * The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.
