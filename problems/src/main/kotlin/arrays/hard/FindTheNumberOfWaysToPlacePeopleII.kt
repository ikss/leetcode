/**
 * You are given a 2D array points of size n x 2 representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane,
 * where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.
 *
 * We define the right direction as positive x-axis (increasing x-coordinate) and the left direction as negative x-axis
 * (decreasing x-coordinate). Similarly, we define the up direction as positive y-axis (increasing y-coordinate) and
 * the down direction as negative y-axis (decreasing y-coordinate)
 *
 * You have to place n people, including Alice and Bob, at these points such that there is exactly one person
 * at every point. Alice wants to be alone with Bob, so Alice will build a rectangular fence with Alice's position as
 * the upper left corner and Bob's position as the lower right corner of the fence (Note that the fence might no
 * t enclose any area, i.e. it can be a line). If any person other than Alice and Bob is either inside the
 * fence or on the fence, Alice will be sad.
 *
 * Return the number of pairs of points where you can place Alice and Bob, such that Alice does not become
 * sad on building the fence.
