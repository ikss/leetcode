/**
 * You are given an m x n binary grid grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
 * An island is a maximal 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of 1's.
 *
 * The grid is said to be connected if we have exactly one island, otherwise is said disconnected.
 *
 * In one day, we are allowed to change any single land cell (1) into a water cell (0).
 *
 * Return the minimum number of days to disconnect the grid.
