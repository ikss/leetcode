/**
 * There are n 1-indexed robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.
 *
 * You are given 0-indexed integer arrays positions, healths, and a string directions (`directions[i]` is either 'L'
 * for left or 'R' for right). All integers in positions are unique.
 *
 * All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions.
 * If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.
 *
 * If two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot
 * decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going.
 * If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.
 *
 * Your task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots
 * were given, i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on.
 * If there are no survivors, return an empty array.
 *
 * Return an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input),
 * after no further collisions can occur.
 *
 * Note: The positions may be unsorted.
