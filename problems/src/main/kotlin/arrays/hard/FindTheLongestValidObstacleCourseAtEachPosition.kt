/**
 * You want to build some obstacle courses. You are given a 0-indexed integer array obstacles of length n,
 * where `obstacles[i]` describes the height of the ith obstacle.
 *
 * For every index i between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), find the length of the longest obstacle course in obstacles such that:
 * * You choose any number of obstacles between 0 and i inclusive.
 * * You must include the ith obstacle in the course.
 * * You must put the chosen obstacles in the same order as they appear in obstacles.
 * * Every obstacle (except the first) is taller than or the same height as the obstacle immediately before it.
 *
 * Return an array ans of length n, where `ans[i]` is the length of the longest obstacle course for index i
 * as described above.
