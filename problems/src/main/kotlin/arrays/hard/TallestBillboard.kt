/**
 * You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height.
 * The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side. Each steel support must be an equal height.
 *
 * You are given a collection of rods that can be welded together. For example, if you have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3,
 * you can weld them together to make a support of length 6.
 *
 * Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation. If you cannot support the billboard, return 0.
