/**
 * There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where `quality[i]` is the quality of the ith
 * worker and `wage[i]` is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.
 *
 * We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers,
 * we must pay them according to the following rules:
 * * Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
 * * In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality.
 * This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid
 * twice as much as the other worker.
 *
 * Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.
 * Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
