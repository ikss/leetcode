/**
 * You are given two integers n and k and two integer arrays speed and efficiency both of length n.
 * There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n. `speed[i]` and `efficiency[i]` represent the speed and efficiency of
 * the ith engineer respectively.
 *
 * Choose at most k different engineers out of the n engineers to form a team with the maximum performance.
 *
 * The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.
 *
 * Return the maximum performance of this team. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
