/**
 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with
 * a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
 *
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an n x k cost matrix costs.
 *
 * For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1
 * with color 2, and so on...
 * Return the minimum cost to paint all houses.
