/**
 * You are given an array of distinct positive integers locations where `locations[i]` represents the position of city i.
 * You are also given integers start, finish and fuel representing the starting city, ending city,
 * and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.
 *
 * At each step, if you are at city i, you can pick any city j such that j != i and 0 <= j < locations.length and move
 * to city j. Moving from city i to city j reduces the amount of fuel you have by `|locations[i] - locations[j]|`.
 * Please notice that |x| denotes the absolute value of x.
 *
 * Notice that fuel cannot become negative at any point in time, and that you are allowed to visit any city more than
 * once (including start and finish).
 *
 * Return the count of all possible routes from start to finish. Since the answer may be too large,
 * return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
