/**
 * You are asked to cut off all the trees in a forest for a golf event.
 * The forest is represented as an m x n matrix. In this matrix:
 * * 0 means the cell cannot be walked through.
 * * 1 represents an empty cell that can be walked through.
 * * A number greater than 1 represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through,
 * and this number is the tree's height.
 *
 * In one step, you can walk in any of the four directions: north, east, south, and west.
 * If you are standing in a cell with a tree, you can choose whether to cut it off.
 *
 * You must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree,
 * the value at its cell becomes 1 (an empty cell).
 *
 * Starting from the point (0, 0), return the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees.
 * If you cannot cut off all the trees, return -1.
 *
 * Note: The input is generated such that no two trees have the same height,
 * and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.
