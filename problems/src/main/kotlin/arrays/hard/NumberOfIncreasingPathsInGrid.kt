/**
 * You are given an m x n integer matrix grid, where you can move from a cell to any adjacent cell in all 4 directions.
 *
 * Return the number of strictly increasing paths in the grid such that you can start from any cell and end at any cell.
 * Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * Two paths are considered different if they do not have exactly the same sequence of visited cells.
