/**
 * Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if
 * you are currently in this cell. The sign of `grid[i][j]` can be:
 * * 1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i][j + 1]`)
 * * 2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i][j - 1]`)
 * * 3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i + 1][j]`)
 * * 4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i - 1][j]`)
 *
 * Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.
 *
 * You will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts
 * from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid.
 * The valid path does not have to be the shortest.
 *
 * You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.
 *
 * Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.
