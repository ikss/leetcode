/**
 * You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent
 * (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).
 *
 * You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties
 * of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.
 *
 * You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is `jobDifficulty[i]`.
 *
 * Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.
