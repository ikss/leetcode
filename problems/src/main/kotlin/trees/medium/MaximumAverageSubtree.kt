/**
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum average value of a subtree of that tree.
 * Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 *
 * A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants.
 *
 * The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.
