/**
 * Given the root of a perfect binary tree, reverse the node values at each odd level of the tree.
 * * For example, suppose the node values at level 3 are `[2,1,3,4,7,11,29,18]`,
 * then it should become `[18,29,11,7,4,3,1,2]`.
 *
 * Return the root of the reversed tree.
 *
 * A binary tree is perfect if all parent nodes have two children and all leaves are on the same level.
 *
 * The level of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.
