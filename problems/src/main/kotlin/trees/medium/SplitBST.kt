/**
 * Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer target, split the tree into two subtrees where the first
 * subtree has nodes that are all smaller or equal to the target value, while the second subtree has all nodes that are
 * greater than the target value. It is not necessarily the case that the tree contains a node with the value target.
 *
 * Additionally, most of the structure of the original tree should remain. Formally, for any child c with parent p in
 * the original tree, if they are both in the same subtree after the split, then node c should still have the parent p.
 *
 * Return an array of the two roots of the two subtrees in order.
