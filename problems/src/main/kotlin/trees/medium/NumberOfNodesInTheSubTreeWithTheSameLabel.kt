/**
 * You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of n nodes numbered from
 * 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. The root of the tree is the node 0, and each node of the tree has a label which
 * is a lower-case character given in the string labels (i.e. The node with the number i has the label `labels[i]`).
 *
 * The edges array is given on the form `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`, which means there is an edge
 * between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
 *
 * Return an array of size n where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the subtree of the ith node
 * which have the same label as node i.
 *
 * A subtree of a tree T is the tree consisting of a node in T and all of its descendant nodes.
