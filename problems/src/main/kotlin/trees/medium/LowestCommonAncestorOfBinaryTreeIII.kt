/**
 * Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).
 *
 * Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for Node is below:
 *
 * class Node {
 *     public int val;
 *     public Node left;
 *     public Node right;
 *     public Node parent;
 * }
 *
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is
 * the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."
