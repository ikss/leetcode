/**
 * You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children.
 * The binary tree has the following definition:
 *
 * struct Node {
 *     int val;
 *     Node *left;
 *     Node *right;
 *     Node *next;
 * }
 *
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node,
 * the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 *
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
