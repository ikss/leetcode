/**
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes, p and q.
 * If either node p or q does not exist in the tree, return null. All values of the nodes in the tree are unique.
 *
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
 * "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a binary tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as
 * descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)".
 *
 * A descendant of a node x is a node y that is on the path from node x to some leaf node.
