/**
 * There exist two undirected trees with n and m nodes, labeled from `[0, n - 1]` and `[0, m - 1]`, respectively.
 *
 * You are given two 2D integer arrays edges1 and edges2 of lengths n - 1 and m - 1, respectively,
 * where `edges1[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the first tree and
 * `edges2[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi in the second tree.
 *
 * Node u is target to node v if the number of edges on the path from u to v is even.
 * Note that a node is always target to itself.
 *
 * Return an array of n integers answer, where `answer[i]` is the maximum possible number of nodes that are target to
 * node i of the first tree if you had to connect one node from the first tree to another node in the second tree.
 *
 * Note that queries are independent from each other.
 * That is, for every query you will remove the added edge before proceeding to the next query.
