/**
 * Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array paths,
 * where `paths[i]` is an array representing an absolute path to the ith folder in the file system.
 *
 * For example, ["one", "two", "three"] represents the path "/one/two/three".
 * Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical
 * subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical.
 * If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.
 *
 * * For example, folders "/a" and "/b" in the file structure below are identical.
 * They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:
 * * * /a
 * * * /a/x
 * * * /a/x/y
 * * * /a/z
 * * * /b
 * * * /b/x
 * * * /b/x/y
 * * * /b/z
 *
 * * However, if the file structure also included the path "/b/w", then the folders "/a" and "/b" would not be identical.
 *
 * Note that "/a/x" and "/b/x" would still be considered identical even with the added folder.
 * Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will delete all of them.
 * The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.
 *
 * Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the marked folders.
 * The paths may be returned in any order.
