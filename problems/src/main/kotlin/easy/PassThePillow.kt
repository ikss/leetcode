/**
 * There are n people standing in a line labeled from 1 to n. The first person in the line is holding a pillow initially.
 * Every second, the person holding the pillow passes it to the next person standing in the line. Once the pillow
 * reaches the end of the line, the direction changes, and people continue passing the pillow in the opposite direction.
 *
 * For example, once the pillow reaches the nth person they pass it to the n - 1th person, then to the n - 2th person
 * and so on.
 * Given the two positive integers n and time, return the index of the person holding the pillow after time seconds.
