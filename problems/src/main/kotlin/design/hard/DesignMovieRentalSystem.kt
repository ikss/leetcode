/**
 * You have a movie renting company consisting of n shops.
 * You want to implement a renting system that supports searching for, booking, and returning movies.
 * The system should also support generating a report of the currently rented movies.
 *
 * Each movie is given as a 2D integer array entries where `entries[i] = [shopi, moviei, pricei]` indicates that there
 * is a copy of movie moviei at shop shopi with a rental price of pricei.
 * Each shop carries at most one copy of a movie moviei.
 *
 * The system should support the following functions:
 * * Search: Finds the cheapest 5 shops that have an unrented copy of a given movie.
 * The shops should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopi should
 * appear first. If there are less than 5 matching shops, then all of them should be returned.
 * If no shop has an unrented copy, then an empty list should be returned.
 * * Rent: Rents an unrented copy of a given movie from a given shop.
 * * Drop: Drops off a previously rented copy of a given movie at a given shop.
 * * Report: Returns the cheapest 5 rented movies (possibly of the same movie ID) as a 2D list res where
 * `res[j] = [shopj, moviej]` describes that the jth cheapest rented movie moviej was rented from the shop shopj.
 * The movies in res should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopj
 * should appear first, and if there is still tie, the one with the smaller moviej should appear first.
 * If there are fewer than 5 rented movies, then all of them should be returned. If no movies are currently being rented,
 * then an empty list should be returned.
 *
 * Implement the MovieRentingSystem class:
 * * MovieRentingSystem(int n, int[][] entries) Initializes the MovieRentingSystem object with n shops and the movies in entries.
 * * List<Integer> search(int movie) Returns a list of shops that have an unrented copy of the given movie as described above.
 * * void rent(int shop, int movie) Rents the given movie from the given shop.
 * * void drop(int shop, int movie) Drops off a previously rented movie at the given shop.
 * * List<List<Integer>> report() Returns a list of cheapest rented movies as described above.
 *
 * Note: The test cases will be generated such that rent will only be called if the shop has an unrented copy of the
 * movie, and drop will only be called if the shop had previously rented out the movie.
