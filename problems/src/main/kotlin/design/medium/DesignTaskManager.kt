import java.util.PriorityQueue

/**
 * There is a task management system that allows users to manage their tasks, each associated with a priority.
 * The system should efficiently handle adding, modifying, executing, and removing tasks.
 *
 * Implement the TaskManager class:
 * * TaskManager(vector<vector<int>>& tasks) initializes the task manager with a list of user-task-priority triples.
 * Each element in the input list is of the form [userId, taskId, priority], which adds a task to the specified user
 * with the given priority.
 * * void add(int userId, int taskId, int priority) adds a task with the specified taskId and priority
 * to the user with userId. It is guaranteed that taskId does not exist in the system.
 * * void edit(int taskId, int newPriority) updates the priority of the existing taskId to newPriority.
 * It is guaranteed that taskId exists in the system.
 * * void rmv(int taskId) removes the task identified by taskId from the system.
 * It is guaranteed that taskId exists in the system.
 * * int execTop() executes the task with the highest priority across all users.
 * If there are multiple tasks with the same highest priority, execute the one with the highest taskId.
 * After executing, the taskId is removed from the system. Return the userId associated with the executed task.
 * If no tasks are available, return -1.
 *
 * Note that a user may be assigned multiple tasks.
