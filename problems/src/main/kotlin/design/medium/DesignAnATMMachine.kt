/**
 * There is an ATM machine that stores banknotes of 5 denominations: 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 dollars.
 * Initially the ATM is empty. The user can use the machine to deposit or withdraw any amount of money.
 *
 * When withdrawing, the machine prioritizes using banknotes of larger values.
 *
 * For example, if you want to withdraw $300 and there are 2 $50 banknotes, 1 $100 banknote, and 1 $200 banknote,
 * then the machine will use the $100 and $200 banknotes.
 * However, if you try to withdraw $600 and there are 3 $200 banknotes and 1 $500 banknote, then the withdraw request
 * will be rejected because the machine will first try to use the $500 banknote and then be unable to use banknotes to complete the remaining $100. Note that the machine is not allowed to use the $200 banknotes instead of the $500 banknote.
 * Implement the ATM class:
 * * ATM() Initializes the ATM object.
 * * void deposit(int[] banknotesCount) Deposits new banknotes in the order $20, $50, $100, $200, and $500.
 * * int[] withdraw(int amount) Returns an array of length 5 of the number of banknotes that will be handed to the user
 * in the order $20, $50, $100, $200, and $500, and update the number of banknotes in the ATM after withdrawing.
 * Returns [-1] if it is not possible (do not withdraw any banknotes in this case).
