/**
 * You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause
 * a triple booking.
 *
 * A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection
 * (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).
 *
 * The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval
 * `[start, end)`, the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
 *
 * Implement the MyCalendarTwo class:
 *
 * MyCalendarTwo() Initializes the calendar object.
 * boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing
 * a triple booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
