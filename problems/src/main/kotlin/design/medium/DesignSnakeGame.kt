/**
 * Design a Snake game that is played on a device with screen size height x width. Play the game online if you are not
 * familiar with the game.
 *
 * The snake is initially positioned at the top left corner (0, 0) with a length of 1 unit.
 *
 * You are given an array food where `food[i] = (ri, ci)` is the row and column position of a piece of food that the
 * snake can eat. When a snake eats a piece of food, its length and the game's score both increase by 1.
 *
 * Each piece of food appears one by one on the screen, meaning the second piece of food will not appear until the
 * snake eats the first piece of food.
 *
 * When a piece of food appears on the screen, it is guaranteed that it will not appear on a block occupied by the snake.
 *
 * The game is over if the snake goes out of bounds (hits a wall) or if its head occupies a space that its body occupies
 * after moving (i.e. a snake of length 4 cannot run into itself).
 *
 * Implement the SnakeGame class:
 *
 * SnakeGame(int width, int height, int[][] food) Initializes the object with a screen of size
 * height x width and the positions of the food.
 * int move(String direction) Returns the score of the game after applying one direction move by the snake.
 * If the game is over, return -1.
