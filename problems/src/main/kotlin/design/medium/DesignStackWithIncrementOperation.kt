/**
 * Design a stack that supports increment operations on its elements.
 *
 * Implement the CustomStack class:
 * * CustomStack(int maxSize) Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack.
 * * void push(int x) Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack has not reached the maxSize.
 * * int pop() Pops and returns the top of the stack or -1 if the stack is empty.
 * * void inc(int k, int val) Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val.
 * If there are less than k elements in the stack, increment all the elements in the stack.
