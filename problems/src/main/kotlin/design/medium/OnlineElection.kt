/**
 * You are given two integer arrays persons and times. In an election, the ith vote was cast for `persons[i]` at time
 * `times[i]`.
 *
 * For each query at a time t, find the person that was leading the election at time t. Votes cast at time t will count
 * towards our query. In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.
 *
 * Implement the TopVotedCandidate class:
 * * TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times) Initializes the object with the persons and times arrays.
 * * int q(int t) Returns the number of the person that was leading the election at time t
 * according to the mentioned rules.
