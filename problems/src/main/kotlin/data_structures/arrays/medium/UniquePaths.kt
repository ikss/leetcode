/**
 * There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]).
 * The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 *
 * Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take
 * to reach the bottom-right corner.
 *
 * The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.
