/**
 * You are given a list of strings of the same length words and a string target.
 *
 * Your task is to form target using the given words under the following rules:
 *
 * target should be formed from left to right.
 * To form the ith character (0-indexed) of target, you can choose the kth character of the jth string in words
 * if `target[i] = words[j][k]`.
 * Once you use the kth character of the jth string of words, you can no longer use the xth character of any string in
 * words where x <= k. In other words, all characters to the left of or at index k become unusuable for every string.
 * Repeat the process until you form the string target.
 * Notice that you can use multiple characters from the same string in words provided the conditions above are met.
 *
 * Return the number of ways to form target from words. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
