/**
 * You have n bulbs in a row numbered from 1 to n. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off.
 * We turn on exactly one bulb every day until all bulbs are on after n days.
 *
 * You are given an array bulbs of length n where `bulbs[i] = x` means that on the (i+1)th day,
 * we will turn on the bulb at position x where i is 0-indexed and x is 1-indexed.
 *
 * Given an integer k, return the minimum day number such that there exists two turned on bulbs that have exactly k
 * bulbs between them that are all turned off. If there isn't such day, return -1.
