 * You are given the head of a linked list and two integers m and n.
 *
 * Traverse the linked list and remove some nodes in the following way:
 * * Start with the head as the current node.
 * * Keep the first m nodes starting with the current node.
 * * Remove the next n nodes
 * * Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until you reach the end of the list.
 *
 * Return the head of the modified list after removing the mentioned nodes.
