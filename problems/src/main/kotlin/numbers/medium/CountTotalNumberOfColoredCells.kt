/**
 * There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer n,
 * indicating that you must do the following routine for n minutes:
 * * At the first minute, color any arbitrary unit cell blue.
 * * Every minute thereafter, color blue every uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.
 *
 * Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes 1, 2, and 3.
