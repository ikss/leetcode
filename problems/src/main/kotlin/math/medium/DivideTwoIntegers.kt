/**
 * Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.
 *
 * The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.
 * For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.
 *
 * Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
 *
 * Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the
 * 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’2^31, 2^31 âˆ’ 1]. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 2^31 - 1,
 * then return 2^31 - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -2^31, then return -2^31.
